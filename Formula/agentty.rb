# Homebrew formula for agentty.
#
# Install:
#   brew tap 1ay1/tap
#   brew install agentty
#
# Downloads the pre-built static binary from the GitHub release on both
# Linux and macOS (CI publishes agentty-{linux,macos}-{arch}). No source
# build: agentty needs C++26 (GCC), which AppleClang doesn't advertise.
#
# After every release: bump `version`, regenerate sha256s from the release
# SHA256SUMS (release.sh emits these automatically).

        agentty

      It talks to Claude via your ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (or `agentty` will prompt
      you to sign in on first run). Docs: https://agentty.org/docs
